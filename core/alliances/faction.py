"""
A Faction is a group representing a wide set of characteristics.

Could be Civilized, Racial or something as precise as Goblins of the yellow pants.

Factions will keep reputation of game objects or other factions.
Civilized would oppose Undeads but they could reject any single character that has attacked them.

Factions should also have rules on what actions they consider favorable or not.

Attacking an enemy faction could Add Reputation while attacking an allied or the same faction Reduces it.
At some reputation the character is banished, more than that it can be set as hostile.

Some reputations scores
 1000 could be loved
    0 could be tolerated
-1000 could be hated
