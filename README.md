# BasicDungeonRL

This is an open source roguelike based on the Basic Fantasy Rpg.
There are two parts to this project, BFLib and the Core.
BFLib is to remain mostly free of game logic so it can be reused
in tools made only for BFRPG.

The first goal of this project is to remain true to the official ruleset
as much as possible with few modifications.
